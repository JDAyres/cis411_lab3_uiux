## 2.1 Summary

|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 18/21 | Overall, LinkedIn's Job application UI experience is well-designed and user-friendly, with a few areas for improvement in terms of overwhelming layouts and limited filter options. However, the site values the user's time and provides a straightforward application process, and is designed to be accessible to all users. |
| Indeed | 17/21 | Overall, Indeed's job application UI experience is generally user-friendly and effective, but there are some areas for improvement, such as the cluttered job listing page and the confusing profile completion form. The site could also be more accessible to users with disabilities.|
